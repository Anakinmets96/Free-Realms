Each player will automatically be placed in the "Ready" mode, and will be paired in a Game against another player in a Hot Streak Event, Wins Event, or Sphere Event (described below) if an Event is already in progress or when a new Event begins.

A player can click the "Cancel" button when being paired against an opponent by Sponsor, which will return the player to the Events Lobby. Before a player begins a Game, the player will be asked to select a deck to play with from the deck selection window. If the player does not select a deck, the player will be disqualified, and the player's opponent will automatically win.
