Free Realms Unpacker is a simple Windows program that I created that can unpack any PACK file that you can find within this repository. 

You can only select one PACK file at a time, view the file name and file size of the contents within the PACK file and extract all of the contents of the PACK file.

NOTE: 
You will not be notified when the contents of the PACK file have been extracted. Open “File Explorer” to see if files are being added to the folder you’ve specified.
