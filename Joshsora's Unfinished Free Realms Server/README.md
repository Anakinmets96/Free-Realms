This archive contains the works of Joshsora (https://www.GitHub.com/Joshsora/)
It includes:

- All of the coding and reverse engineering done by Joshsora in it's final state.
- A pre-built version of the final server.
- The packet logs supplied by Womayhem.
- Utilities created by Joshsora to aid development.

Sadly, the WebAPI has been lost so none of this works, but it's easy enough to reproduce if you have the source code.

NOTE:
This server will not get you past the loading screen, as that part was never figured out.
The loading screen does not complete because the game hangs waiting for "character data".
The client does think that it has joined a world, and has successfully logged in.


For anyone who is not a developer, THIS IS NOT PLAYABLE!
